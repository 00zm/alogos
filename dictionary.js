// dictionaries are also called maps and associative arrays
// stores data in key value pairs
// every key can appear only once in dictionary every key can only have one value
// dictionaries are build upon hashtables
// average time complexity equations
// access,insert,delete,searching O(1)
// worst case equation (as for worst case hash function gives same index for all values which then are stored in a linked list (collision solution case))
// access,insert,delete,searching O(n)
