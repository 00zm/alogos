// leetcode 280;
// lintcode 508
// sort array such that a < b > c < d ....
// it can be done using sorting in nlogn so sort the array and then swap adjacent elements or divide after sorting and take one element from each part and so on
// to do in o(n) time simple swaps can be performed check whether the index is odd or even
// then check the corresponding condition if not fulfilled perform a swap and so on
// so this can be done in O(n) as no sorting is being done
